Case in point: when that feral <strong>{{item:4|Ash-Stalker}}</strong> ambushed them yesterday, its paralyzing venom had completely washed over the human. Han had seen the stinger pierce Jan's shoulder, yet the idiot just punched the beast in the jaw and kept walking. <em>Humans aren't immune to neuro-toxins,</em> Han thought, narrowing his eyes at Jan's back. <em>So what the hell is protecting him?</em></p>
